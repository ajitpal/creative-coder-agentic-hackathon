# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Intelligent Healthcare Navigator is an agentic AI application that assists users by providing simplified, actionable healthcare information. The application follows the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern, using Google Gemini API as the core reasoning engine and integrating with multiple external healthcare APIs to deliver comprehensive medical insights. The system is designed as an MVP for a 2-hour hackathon timeframe, focusing on clear functionality and user-friendly interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a healthcare consumer, I want to understand complex medical terms and diseases in plain language, so that I can better comprehend my health information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs a medical term or disease name THEN the system SHALL retrieve authoritative definitions from WHO ICD API
2. WHEN the system receives medical terminology THEN it SHALL use Gemini API to simplify the explanation into plain language
3. WHEN displaying medical explanations THEN the system SHALL present information in an easily digestible format
4. IF a medical term is not found in WHO ICD API THEN the system SHALL use Gemini's knowledge base as a fallback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a patient or caregiver, I want to access current drug recall and adverse event information, so that I can make informed decisions about medications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user queries about a specific drug THEN the system SHALL retrieve real-time data from openFDA API
2. WHEN drug recall information is available THEN the system SHALL display recall details, dates, and severity levels
3. WHEN adverse event data exists THEN the system SHALL present common side effects and safety warnings
4. IF no FDA data is available for a drug THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest alternative information sources

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user experiencing symptoms, I want general insights about potential health considerations, so that I can better understand when to seek professional medical care.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user describes symptoms THEN the system SHALL use Gemini API to provide general insights and considerations
2. WHEN providing symptom insights THEN the system SHALL clearly state it does not provide medical diagnosis
3. WHEN symptoms suggest urgent care THEN the system SHALL recommend seeking immediate professional medical attention
4. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL include appropriate medical disclaimers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional or patient, I want to upload and summarize medical documents including prescriptions and medical reports, so that I can quickly understand key information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a medical document (prescription, medical report, lab results) THEN the system SHALL process text content for summarization
2. WHEN processing prescriptions THEN the system SHALL extract medication names, dosages, and instructions
3. WHEN processing medical reports THEN the system SHALL identify key findings, diagnoses, and recommendations
4. WHEN summarizing documents THEN the system SHALL use SummerTime library or Metriport API for text summarization
5. WHEN presenting summaries THEN the system SHALL highlight critical information like medications, conditions, and follow-up instructions
6. IF document format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL inform the user of supported formats (PDF, TXT, DOC)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher or healthcare worker, I want to extract medical entities from free text, so that I can quickly identify key medical information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing free text input THEN the system SHALL identify diseases, drugs, and symptoms using Fast Data Science libraries
2. WHEN medical entities are extracted THEN the system SHALL categorize them by type (disease, drug, symptom)
3. WHEN displaying extracted entities THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores where available
4. WHEN no entities are found THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest text refinement

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer or system administrator, I want the application to follow the ReAct agentic pattern, so that the system can reason about queries and execute appropriate actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving user queries THEN the planner module SHALL analyze the request and create sub-tasks
2. WHEN sub-tasks are identified THEN the executor module SHALL coordinate API calls and tool usage
3. WHEN processing requests THEN the memory module SHALL maintain conversation context and user preferences
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle failures gracefully and provide meaningful feedback

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the system through a simple interface, so that I can easily access healthcare information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the application THEN the system SHALL provide either CLI or Streamlit web interface
2. WHEN using the interface THEN users SHALL be able to input text queries, upload documents, and view responses
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the interface SHALL present information in a clear, organized format
4. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL use .env file for API key management

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the application to properly integrate with Google Gemini API, so that the system can leverage advanced AI reasoning capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use Google Gemini API for natural language understanding
2. WHEN orchestrating tool usage THEN Gemini SHALL use function calling to coordinate external API interactions
3. WHEN processing complex queries THEN Gemini SHALL provide reasoning and context for its responses
4. IF Gemini API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and fallback options

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to follow the specified technical structure, so that the application is maintainable and follows hackathon requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL use src/ directory structure with planner.py, executor.py, and memory.py modules
2. WHEN documenting code THEN each module SHALL include clear docstrings and comments
3. WHEN setting up the environment THEN the system SHALL include requirements.txt and setup instructions
4. WHEN delivering the MVP THEN the code SHALL be functional within the 2-hour hackathon timeframe constraint
